# Python-Anoying-Bot
This is a project I made that logs into your facebook account and sends a word per minute from a txt file. I did it because I was too bored so I needed to entertain myself with something.

The program can run with the normal command "py python-anoying-bot.py";
If it does not work that's because it didn't load the page and you maybe need to add another time.sleep(10) somewhere but usually it works after running the bot 2 or 3 times.
Feel free to use it to annoy your friends.
