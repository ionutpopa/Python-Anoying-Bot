# Python-Anoying-Bot

The program can run with the normal command "py python-anoying-bot.py";
If it does not work that's because it didn't load the page and you maybe need to add another time.sleep(10) somewhere but usually it works after running the bot 2 or 3 times.
Feel free to use it to annoy your friends.
